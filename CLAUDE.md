# Project Guidelines for Claude

## Slide Presentation Best Practices

When creating or editing slides (especially in Slidev format):

### One Idea Per Slide
- Each slide should contain ONE major concept
- Avoid the "bullet-riddled corpse" anti-pattern
- Better to have many simple slides than few dense ones

### Content Guidelines
- Maximum 5-6 bullet points per slide
- Use progressive disclosure across multiple slides
- Keep code examples short and focused (5-10 lines max)
- Leave visual breathing room

### Example Structure
```markdown
---
## Single Concept Title

Key point or statement

Supporting detail if needed
---
```

Instead of cramming everything into one slide, spread related concepts across 2-3 slides.

## Project Context

This is a Junie training repository for teaching JetBrains' AI coding assistant across multiple IDEs. The training includes:
- Hands-on labs in Java, Python, and TypeScript
- MCP tool integration (context7, Playwright)
- Focus on practical application over theory

## Lab Instructions

When creating lab instructions:
- Provide clear starting code
- List specific tasks numbered 1-5
- Include expected outcomes
- Specify time estimates
- Add hints for common issues

## Implementation Tips
1. Download images in high resolution (1920x1080 minimum)
2. Add to `/images` folder in your project
3. Reference in slides: `![alt text](/images/filename.jpg)`
4. Consider adding subtle opacity for text readability
5. Use CSS filters for color coordination: `filter: hue-rotate(240deg) saturate(0.5);`
